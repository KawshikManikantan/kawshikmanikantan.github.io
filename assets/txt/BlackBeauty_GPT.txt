Part I 01 My#1 Early Home The first place that I#1 can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it . Some shady trees leaned over it , and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end . Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field , and on the other we looked over a gate at our#3 master#3 's#3 house , which stood by the roadside ; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees , and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank . While I#1 was young I#1 lived upon my#2 mother#2 's#2 milk , as I#1 could not eat grass . In the daytime I#1 ran by her#2 side , and at night I#1 lay down close by her#2 . When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees , and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove . As soon as I#1 was old enough to eat grass my#2 mother#2 used to go out to work in the daytime , and come back in the evening . There were six young colts#5 in the meadow besides me#1 ; they#5 were older than I#1 was ; some#5 were nearly as large as grown-up horses . I#1 used to run with them#5 , and had great fun ; we#5 used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we#5 could go . Sometimes we#5 had rather rough play , for they#5 would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop . One day , when there was a good deal of kicking , my#2 mother#2 whinnied to me#1 to come to her#2 , and then she#2 said : " I#2 wish you#1 to pay attention to what I#2 am going to say to you#1 . The colts#5 who live here are very good colts#5 , but they#5 are cart-horse colts#5 , and of course they#5 have not learned manners . You#1 have been well-bred and well-born ; your father has a great name in these parts , and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races ; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I#2 ever knew , and I#2 think you#1 have never seen me#2 kick or bite . I#2 hope you#1 will grow up gentle and good , and never learn bad ways ; do your work with a good will , lift your feet up well when you trot , and never bite or kick even in play . " I#1 have never forgotten my#2 mother#2 's#2 advice ; I#1 knew she#2 was a wise old horse , and our#3 master#3 thought a great deal of her#2 . Her#2 name was Duchess#2 , but he#3 often called her#2 Pet . Our#3 master#3 was a good , kind man . He#3 gave us good food , good lodging , and kind words ; he#3 spoke as kindly to us as he#3 did to his little children . We were all fond of him#3 , and my#2 mother#2 loved him#3 very much . When she#2 saw him#3 at the gate she#2 would neigh with joy , and trot up to him#3 . He#3 would pat and stroke her#2 and say , " Well , old Pet , and how is your little Darkie ? " I#1 was a dull black , so he#3 called me#1 Darkie ; then he#3 would give me#1 a piece of bread , which was very good , and sometimes he#3 brought a carrot for my#2 mother#2 . All the horses would come to him#3 , but I#1 think we#1 were his#3 favorites . My#2 mother#2 always took him#3 to the town on a market day in a light gig . There was a plowboy , Dick#4 , who sometimes came into our field to pluck blackberries from the hedge . When he#4 had eaten all he#4 wanted he#4 would have what he#4 called fun with the colts#5 , throwing stones and sticks at them#5 to make them#5 gallop . We#5 did not much mind him#4 , for we#5 could gallop off ; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us#5 . One day he#4 was at this game , and did not know that the master#3 was in the next field ; but he#3 was there , watching what was going on ; over the hedge he#3 jumped in a snap , and catching Dick#4 by the arm , he#3 gave him#4 such a box on the ear as made him#4 roar with the pain and surprise . As soon as we#5 saw the master#3 we#5 trotted up nearer to see what went on . " Bad boy ! " he#3 said , " bad boy ! to chase the colts#5 . This is not the first time , nor the second , but it shall be the last . There -- take your money and go home ; I#3 shall not want you#4 on my#3 farm again . " So we#5 never saw Dick#4 any more . Old Daniel , the man who looked after the horses , was just as gentle as our#3 master#3 , so we#1 were well off . 02 The Hunt Before I#1 was two years old a circumstance happened which I#1 have never forgotten . It was early in the spring ; there had been a little frost in the night , and a light mist still hung over the woods and meadows . I#1 and the other colts#5 were feeding at the lower part of the field when we#5 heard , quite in the distance , what sounded like the cry of dogs . The oldest of the colts#5 raised his head , pricked his ears , and said , " There are the hounds ! " and immediately cantered off , followed by the rest of us#5 to the upper part of the field , where we#5 could look over the hedge and see several fields beyond . My#2 mother#2 and an old riding horse of our#3 master#3 's#3 were also standing near , and seemed to know all about it . " They have found a hare , " said my#2 mother#2 , " and if they come this way we#1 shall see the hunt . " And soon the dogs were all tearing down the field of young wheat next to ours . I#1 never heard such a noise as they made . They did not bark , nor howl , nor whine , but kept on a " yo ! yo , o , o ! yo ! yo , o , o ! " at the top of their voices . After them came a number of men on horseback , some of them in green coats , all galloping as fast as they could . The old horse snorted and looked eagerly after them , and we#5 young colts#5 wanted to be galloping with them , but they were soon away into the fields lower down ; here it seemed as if they had come to a stand ; the dogs left off barking , and ran about every way with their noses to the ground . " They have lost the scent , " said the old horse ; " perhaps the hare will get off . " " What hare ? " I#1 said . " Oh ! I#1 do n't know what hare ; likely enough it may be one of our own hares out of the woods ; any hare they can find will do for the dogs and men to run after ; " and before long the dogs began their " yo ! yo , o , o ! " again , and back they came altogether at full speed , making straight for our meadow at the part where the high bank and hedge overhang the brook . " Now we#1 shall see the hare , " said my#2 mother#2 ; and just then a hare wild with fright rushed by and made for the woods . On came the dogs ; they burst over the bank , leaped the stream , and came dashing across the field followed by the huntsmen . Six or eight men leaped their horses clean over , close upon the dogs . The hare tried to get through the fence ; it was too thick , and she turned sharp round to make for the road , but it was too late ; the dogs were upon her with their wild cries ; we#1 heard one shriek , and that was the end of her . One of the huntsmen rode up and whipped off the dogs , who would soon have torn her to pieces . He held her up by the leg torn and bleeding , and all the gentlemen seemed well pleased . As for me#1 , I#1 was so astonished that I#1 did not at first see what was going on by the brook ; but when I#1 did look there was a sad sight ; two fine horses were down , one was struggling in the stream , and the other was groaning on the grass . One of the riders was getting out of the water covered with mud , the other lay quite still . " His neck is broke , " said my#2 mother#2 . " And serve him right , too , " said one of the colts#5 . I#1 thought the same , but my#2 mother#2 did not join with us . " Well , no , " she#2 said , " you#1 must not say that ; but though I#2 am an old horse , and have seen and heard a great deal , I#2 never yet could make out why men are so fond of this sport ; they often hurt themselves , often spoil good horses , and tear up the fields , and all for a hare or a fox , or a stag , that they could get more easily some other way ; but we#1 are only horses , and do n't know . " While my#2 mother#2 was saying this we#1 stood and looked on . Many of the riders had gone to the young man ; but my#3 master#3 , who had been watching what was going on , was the first to raise him . His head fell back and his arms hung down , and every one looked very serious . There was no noise now ; even the dogs were quiet , and seemed to know that something was wrong . They carried him to our#3 master#3 's#3 house . I#1 heard afterward that it was young George Gordon , the squire 's only son , a fine , tall young man , and the pride of his family . There was now riding off in all directions to the doctor 's , to the farrier 's , and no doubt to Squire Gordon 's , to let him know about his son . When Mr. Bond , the farrier , came to look at the black horse that lay groaning on the grass , he felt him all over , and shook his head ; one of his legs was broken . Then some one ran to our#3 master#3 's#3 house and came back with a gun ; presently there was a loud bang and a dreadful shriek , and then all was still ; the black horse moved no more . My#2 mother#2 seemed much troubled ; she#2 said she#2 had known that horse for years , and that his name was " Rob Roy " ; he was a good horse , and there was no vice in him . She#2 never would go to that part of the field afterward .
